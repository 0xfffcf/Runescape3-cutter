> # Introduction.

* I am putting all those scripts online because I've realise that no one has made tutorial for Kraken.
* I am willing to help the community of scripter a lot and I am far from being a professional when it comes to it.

<br/>

> # Features.

* Dead Tree
* Basic tree
* Oak Tree
* Willow Tree
* Maple Tree
* Yew Tree
* Ivy
* Magic Tree

<br/>

> # Setup.

```
Build the source code to .jar and place it into the plugin kraken's folder
```

<br/>

> # Future.

* I will add more type of tree.
* I will add more location for the tree and try to make f2p location.
